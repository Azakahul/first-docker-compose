## Swarm Notes:

This is a collection of notes on how to properly scale a docker container via docker swarm.

## To Create New VMs Via Hyperv:

1. Setup a switch in hyper v (assuming you have installed hyperv)
    1. Launch Hyper-V Manager
    1. Click Virtual Switch Manager in the right-hand menu
    1. Click Create Virtual Switch of type External
    1. Give it the name myswitch, and check the box to share your host machineâ€™s active network adapter
1. Make several hyperv vms to load balance against
    1. ```docker-machine create -d hyperv --hyperv-virtual-switch "myswitch" <leader vm>```
    1. ```docker-machine create -d hyperv --hyperv-virtual-switch "myswitch" <slave vm>``` 
    1. To confirm they are created: ```docker-machine ls```
    1. To restart a machine: ```docker-machine start <node-name>```

## Initializing a Docker Swarm and Adding Nodes:

1. Initialize one vm to be the manager
    1. ```docker-machine ssh <leader node> "docker swarm init --advertise-addr <myvm1 ip>"``` Note that ```docker-machine ls``` will give you the ip needed.
        1. USE PORT 2377 NOT 2376
1. Setup the second to join the now existing swarm
    1. ```docker-machine ssh <slave node> "docker swarm join --token <token> <ip>:2377"```
1. Run the following to view the nodes within the swarm
    1. ```docker-machine ssh <leader node> "docker node ls"```
1. If you wish to start over you can run the following for each node
    1. ```docker-machine ssh <node-name> "docker swarm leave"```
